	INSTALLATION:

	1.) Place the plugin (simplyPicasaWeb.php) in your wp-content/plugins/simplyPicasaWeb directory. (create the simplyPicasaWeb directory if necessary)

	2.) put the lastRss.php file in your simplyPicasaWeb directory

	3.) Enable the Simply Picasaweb plugin in the "Plugins" section of your WordPress administration panel.


	UPGRADING:

	1.) Overwrite your simplyPicasaWeb.php file

	2.) enjoy

	DATE		MODIFICATION								AUTHOR
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
22 Nov 2006		Updated to support new parameters such as size				finalcut
			(change the size of your thumbnails that come 
			from google), pass in just a username (instead of 
			the whole URL), or a username and albumid (to easily 
			show thumbnails from a particular album). It is even 
			easier to use now that before!

07 Feb 2007		You can now have the plugin pick one of your albums at			finalcut
			random and display images from it.. Just set the 
			showRandomAlbum parameter=true and don’t provide a URL or 
			albumid (just a username).

16 Feb 2007		added new argument “linkToAlbum” which will force thumbnails		finalcut
			to link to their containing album instead of to a full size 
			version of the image.

09 Mar 2007		Google changed their feed format so I had to update to fix		finalcut
			it. If you are installing or updating after this date READ 
			the readme.txt IT IS IMPORTANT or else your install won’t 
			work.

14 Mar 2007		A big update that deals with the Google feed change. See		finalcut
			the readme.pdf file for more info on installation. This 
			version uses a stripped down version of the Zend Framework. 
			Also, make sure you revert back to the old rss.php in your 
			wp-includes directory if you grabbed the 09 Mar 2007 update.

31 Oct 2007		A nice update that removes the Zend framework dependency. A		finalcut
			huge thanks to Kiro for his work using lastRSS to handle the
			Google feed. This also fixes a problem where feeds wouldn’t 
			load at all because Google changed the path to the album feeds.

08 Nov 2007		Minor update that resolves a FATAL ERROR when activating the		finalcut
			plugin on some hosts.

02 Feb 2009		Renamed to Simply Picasaweb so I can be offered on the official		finalcut
			wordpress plugins site. Also added a new feature to let you 
			include thumbnails within a blog posting.

	version.


== KNOWN ISSUES ==
	You can't use this to show stuff from private albums yet.  Perhaps someday I'll add support for that.


== USAGE ==
	From anywhere in your WordPress template, call the function 
	"picasaWeb(...)", which takes the following parameters (all 
	parameters, except username, have default values) you can pass in either a named array of parameters or
	pass the parameters in order as follows:

	a)username:	your picasaweb username - REQUIRED
	b)albumid:	picasaweb assigns each album an id; provide this if you want to show a specific albums thumbnails.  - OPTIONAL
	c)random:	true/false – set to true if you want to display a random set of thumbnails – OPTIONAL default=false
	d)num:		the number of thumbnails you want to display. Set to 0 if you want to show all thumbnails returned - OPTIONAL default=0
	e)size:		the dimensions you want the thumbnails in selected from the following options: 144, 160, 288, 576, or 720.  NOTE: no other sizes are supported by picasaweb.  - OPTIONAL default=160
	f)showRandomAlbum:	true/false this is ignored if an albumid is provided.  If set to true then will randomly select an album from the users available albums to show thumbnails from. - OPTIONAL default=false
	g)LinkToAlbum:	true/false – if true the thumbnail will link to the images containing album; else it links to a full size version of the image. - OPTIONAL default=false
	h)LinkToSourceImage: true/false - Only used if LinkToAlbum is false; if LinkToSourceImage is true then the link will go to a large version of the image - HOWEVER, clicking on the link will load a 404 error and require the user
						to click in the address bar and then hit enter becuase Google doesn't allow this kind of linking.  While this seems useless perhaps someone will have use for access to this url.
				
	FILTER USAGE

		[!--picasaweb:username:=bill.rawlinson,albumid:=5206150637658041777,random:=false,num:=5,showRandomAlbum:=false,linkToAlbum:=false,size:=144--]


	TEMPLATE USAGE

		<? 
			picasaWeb(array(	"username"=>"bill.rawlinson",
								"albumid"=>"=5206150637658041777",
								"random"=>false,
								"num"=>3,
								showRandomAlbum=>false,
								linkToAlbum=>false, 
								"size"=>144)); 
		?>

== Troubleshooting ==
	Make sure the album you're trying to reference is public.  To get the "albumid" click on the "share" link of the albums sidebar, and then get the aid value from the 
	address loaded in the address bar.  For Example:
		http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/emailAlbum?uname=bill.rawlinson&aid=5206150637658041777  the albumid in this url is: 5206150637658041777
